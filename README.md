This is a collection of the dotfiles required to use my personal integration of i3wm. Be sure to drop all included scripts in the `scripts` folder into `/usr/lib/i3blocks/`

I have defined thresholds for all values. And when these values are surpassed, the respective block will show a red background to indicate that it is in an unhealthy state.
