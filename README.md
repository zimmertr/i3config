#i3config


This is a collection of the dotfiles required to use my personal integration of i3wm. 

I have defined thresholds for all values. And when these values are surpassed, the respective block will show a red background to indicate that it is in an unhealthy state.

##Using i3blocks, I monitor the following metrics:

- Computer Volume

- OS Package Updates

- Computer Uptime

- Computer Temperature

- Outside Temperature

- Day, Date, and Time

- CPU Usage

- Memory Usage

- Computer Load

- Network Usage (Up/Down)

- Disk Usage (Read/Write)
